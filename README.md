## Built by Ethereum and Angular

This code was written by me, during taking the course "Ethereum Developer Masterclass: Build Real World Projects" in Udemy.

Unlike tutorial, it has built with Angular as a front end.

Although it was inspired by the code written in tutorial videos, this repository doesn't contain any thing copy-pasted or mechanically copyrighted.
